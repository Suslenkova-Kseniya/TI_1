Simple ciphers
Task 5:
Write a program that encrypts and decrypts a text file of any size containing text in a given language, using the following encryption algorithms:
- A permutation cipher: a "column method" with one keyword, text in English;
- two substitution ciphers: Vigenere algorithm, progressive key, text in Russian. Decimation method text in English.
For all algorithms, the key is set from the keyboard by the user.
The program must ignore all characters that are not letters of a given alphabet, and encrypt only the text in a given language. All algorithms must be implemented in a single program. The program must not be written in console mode. The result of the program is encrypted/decrypted file/s.
